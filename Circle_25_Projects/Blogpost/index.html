    <p>
      Occupational therapy (OT) is a client-centered health profession concerned
      with promoting health and well-being through occupation. The primary goal
      of occupational therapy is to enable people to participate in the
      activities of everyday life. Occupational therapists achieve this outcome
      by working with people and communities to enhance their ability to engage
      in the occupations they want to, need to, or are expected to do, or by
      modifying the occupation or the environment to better support their
      occupational engagement.

    <p>
      Occupational therapy plays a crucial role in helping individuals of all
      ages achieve a higher quality of life. It is a versatile field that
      addresses physical, psychological, and social aspects of well-being,
      thereby fostering holistic health. From assisting children with
      developmental challenges to supporting elderly individuals in maintaining
      their independence, occupational therapists work across diverse settings
      and with various populations.

    <p>
      Moreover, occupational therapy emphasizes the importance of context in
      therapeutic interventions. By considering the client's environment,
      cultural background, and social support systems, occupational therapists
      ensure that their approach is relevant and effective. This holistic
      perspective distinguishes occupational therapy from other health
      professions and underscores its significance in promoting comprehensive
      well-being.

    <p>
      In addition to direct client interventions, occupational therapists also
      advocate for accessible and inclusive environments. They collaborate with
      communities, policymakers, and organizations to create supportive settings
      that enable all individuals to participate fully in their chosen
      activities. This advocacy extends the impact of occupational therapy
      beyond individual clients to benefit society as a whole.
