      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>
	This project demonstrates the process of provisioning a Linux server, setting up a web server,
	and deploying a custom HTML landing page. It showcases the foundational skills necessary for
	cloud server management and web development while highlighting the potential for scalable solutions.
      </p>
      <h2>Project Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
	<li>Provision a Linux server on a virtualization or cloud platform (e.g., AWS).</li>
	<li>Install and configure a web server (Apache or Nginx).</li>
	<li>Deploy a custom HTML landing page with detailed project information.</li>
	<li>Configure the server for public access via HTTP.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Outcomes</h2>
      <p>
	The project successfully provides a live demonstration of technical capabilities by deploying
	a landing page accessible via the server's public IP. This serves as a proof of concept for a
	scalable web application.
      </p>
      <h2>Future Scope</h2>
      <p>
	Future enhancements could include adding HTTPS support using SSL certificates, integrating dynamic
	content with backend services, and expanding functionality to support user interactions.
