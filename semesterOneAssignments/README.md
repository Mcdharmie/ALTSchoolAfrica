Introduction
This project consists of two interconnected web pages:

Personal Information Page: This page contains details about the user, including their AltSchool ID, biography, reasons for joining AltSchool, and goals for the School of Engineering program. A fragment identifier is used to create a scrolling feature to the top of the page.

Application Form Page: This page replicates the AltSchool application form. The two pages are linked via a global navigation menu, making it easy for users to navigate between them.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate an understanding of semantic HTML, navigation, and form handling in a web development context.

Features
Personal Information Page:

Displays user biography and other relevant details.
Contains a fragment identifier to scroll back to the top.
Includes global navigation to the form page.
Application Form Page:

A replica of the AltSchool application form.
Accessible design with proper semantic HTML.
Linked to the personal information page through global navigation.
Navigation:

Both pages include a global navigation menu for easy access between them.
Accessibility:

The pages are designed using semantic HTML tags to ensure they are accessible.
Technologies Used
HTML5: For the structure and semantic layout of the web pages.
CSS3: For styling the web pages to enhance user experience.

Usage
Personal Information Page: This page includes sections for your AltSchool ID, a short biography, your reasons for joining AltSchool, and your goals for the School of Engineering program. Use the navigation menu to switch to the Application Form Page.

Application Form Page: This page replicates the AltSchool application form. It can be accessed via the global navigation menu from the Personal Information Page.

Scroll to Top Feature: On the Personal Information Page, use the fragment identifier link to scroll back to the top of the page quickly.

Accessibility
Semantic HTML: All pages use semantic HTML tags (like <header>, <main>, <section>, <footer>) to enhance accessibility.

Navigation: The global navigation menu is consistently placed on both pages, allowing users to move seamlessly between them.
